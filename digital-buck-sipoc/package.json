The React.js dependency is included in your package.json - it's listed as "react" and "react-dom". However, let's update your package.json versions to be consistent. Click on package.json and edit it to:

```json
{
  "name": "digital-buck-sipoc",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "12.0.0",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
    "lucide-react": "0.263.1",
    "framer-motion": "6.0.0",
    "@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog": "1.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "3.0.0",
    "autoprefixer": "10.4.0",
    "postcss": "8.4.0"
  }
}
```

After updating, try deploying again with a new project name like "sipoc-diagram-v3".
